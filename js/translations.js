    // FAQ Section
    'faq.title': 'Frequently Asked Questions',
    'faq.q1.question': 'What data do I need to provide?',
    'faq.q1.answer': 'We preferably ask for 12 months of item-level sales data exported from your POS, ideally as a CSV or Excel file. If you do not have a full year yet, we can start from at least around 90 days of history, but forecasts will be more stable and useful with longer data. Your export should at least include the date, item name and quantity sold. If you are unsure how to export this, we are happy to help.',
    'faq.q2.question': 'What will I actually do day to day?',
    'faq.q2.answer': 'In practice, most restaurants simply check the dashboard once a day or a few times a week. You look at the next 7 days, see how busy each day is expected to be compared to your usual days and then adjust your prep, ordering and staff planning accordingly. It is designed to be a quick check before you make your decisions, not another system you need to manage.',
    'faq.q3.question': 'How long does setup take?',
    'faq.q3.answer': 'Setup takes one business day. Once you have exported your sales data and uploaded it to Deitalite, we prepare your forecast dashboard and send you your login details within one business day.',
    'faq.q4.question': 'Do I need to upload new data after the first month?',
    'faq.q4.answer': 'Yes. If you decide to continue after your first 30 days, we ask you to upload your latest sales data again. That way, your forecast stays up to date and reflects your most recent weeks and months. The process is the same simple export and upload you do the first time.',
    'faq.q5.question': 'What if I do not have 12 months of data yet?',
    'faq.q5.answer': 'You can still get started. We can work with less history, as long as you have at least around 90 days of sales data. However, forecasts will be more reliable once you have a full year, because the system can see more patterns such as seasonality. If you start earlier, you can always upload more history later so the forecast can improve over time.',
    'faq.q6.question': 'What if my menu changed in between?',
    'faq.q6.answer': 'Menu changes are normal. For the most accurate predictions, each item should ideally have at least 90 days of sales history. Newer dishes with less history can still be included, but their predictions will be less precise. If needed, we can also discuss grouping similar items so the forecast still gives you helpful guidance for prep and ordering.',
    'faq.q7.question': 'How accurate are the forecasts?',
    'faq.q7.answer': 'Forecasts are never perfect, but they are designed to be accurate enough to meaningfully improve your planning. Daily forecasts are typically within 15–20% of actual sales, 80% of the time, especially when there is at least 12 months of sales history to learn from. Accuracy is highest for items and days where you have more history; with shorter histories of around 90 days, you can expect more variation.<br><br>In practice, restaurants use the forecast to reduce waste, avoid clear over- or understaffing and spot days that are likely to be quieter or busier than usual, rather than to hit an exact number every single time.',
    'faq.q8.question': 'Can I cancel anytime?',
    'faq.q8.answer': 'You do not need to cancel anything. You pay once for 30 days of access, and it stops automatically at the end of that period. If you want to continue, you simply choose to purchase another month and send us your updated sales data. This way we make sure that your custom-made forecast is aware of the latest sales trends and items from your restaurant.',
    'faq.q9.question': 'Do you integrate with my POS system?',
    'faq.q9.answer': 'At the moment, we do not connect directly to POS systems. You export your sales data from your POS and upload it to Deitalite. Most systems make this export possible in just a few clicks. We are working towards direct integrations with major POS providers in the future, and early users will be the first to benefit from these.',
    'faq.q10.question': 'Is my data secure?',
    'faq.q10.answer': 'Yes. Your data is stored in a secure environment and is only used to create forecasts for your restaurant. Access is limited, and we do not share your sales data with third parties. If you ever want your data to be removed, you can let us know and we will delete it.',
    'faq.q11.question': 'What locations do you support?',
    'faq.q11.answer': 'We support restaurants worldwide. Weather information is updated automatically from accurate global coverage and combined with your sales history to produce your forecast. Pricing is in euros, but we are happy to work with restaurants in any country.',
    'faq.q12.question': 'Does the dashboard include drinks?',
    'faq.q12.answer': 'Currently, the dashboard focuses on food items. We are working on adding drink forecasting capabilities and expect to launch this feature in early 2026.',
    'faq.q13.question': 'What\'s coming next?',
    'faq.q13.answer': 'We are developing drink forecasting and category-level predictions, planned for launch in early 2026. Early users will be the first to get access to these new features.',

    'faq.q1.question': 'What data do I need to provide?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q1.answer': 'We preferably ask for 12 months of item-level sales data exported from your POS, ideally as a CSV or Excel file. If you do not have a full year yet, we can start from at least around 90 days of history, but forecasts will be more stable and useful with longer data. Your export should at least include the date, item name and quantity sold. If you are unsure how to export this, we are happy to help.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q2.question': 'What will I actually do day to day?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q2.answer': 'In practice, most restaurants simply check the dashboard once a day or a few times a week. You look at the next 7 days, see how busy each day is expected to be compared to your usual days and then adjust your prep, ordering and staff planning accordingly. It is designed to be a quick check before you make your decisions, not another system you need to manage.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q3.question': 'How long does setup take?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q3.answer': 'Setup takes one business day. Once you have exported your sales data and uploaded it to Deitalite, we prepare your forecast dashboard and send you your login details within one business day.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q4.question': 'Do I need to upload new data after the first month?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q4.answer': 'Yes. If you decide to continue after your first 30 days, we ask you to upload your latest sales data again. That way, your forecast stays up to date and reflects your most recent weeks and months. The process is the same simple export and upload you do the first time.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q5.question': 'What if I do not have 12 months of data yet?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q5.answer': 'You can still get started. We can work with less history, as long as you have at least around 90 days of sales data. However, forecasts will be more reliable once you have a full year, because the system can see more patterns such as seasonality. If you start earlier, you can always upload more history later so the forecast can improve over time.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q6.question': 'What if my menu changed in between?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q6.answer': 'Menu changes are normal. For the most accurate predictions, each item should ideally have at least 90 days of sales history. Newer dishes with less history can still be included, but their predictions will be less precise. If needed, we can also discuss grouping similar items so the forecast still gives you helpful guidance for prep and ordering.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q7.question': 'How accurate are the forecasts?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q7.answer': 'Forecasts are never perfect, but they are designed to be accurate enough to meaningfully improve your planning. Daily forecasts are typically within 15–20% of actual sales, 80% of the time, especially when there is at least 12 months of sales history to learn from. Accuracy is highest for items and days where you have more history; with shorter histories of around 90 days, you can expect more variation.<br><br>In practice, restaurants use the forecast to reduce waste, avoid clear over- or understaffing and spot days that are likely to be quieter or busier than usual, rather than to hit an exact number every single time.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q8.question': 'Can I cancel anytime?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q8.answer': 'You do not need to cancel anything. You pay once for 30 days of access, and it stops automatically at the end of that period. If you want to continue, you simply choose to purchase another month and send us your updated sales data. This way we make sure that your custom-made forecast is aware of the latest sales trends and items from your restaurant.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q9.question': 'Do you integrate with my POS system?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q9.answer': 'At the moment, we do not connect directly to POS systems. You export your sales data from your POS and upload it to Deitalite. Most systems make this export possible in just a few clicks. We are working towards direct integrations with major POS providers in the future, and early users will be the first to benefit from these.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q10.question': 'Is my data secure?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q10.answer': 'Yes. Your data is stored in a secure environment and is only used to create forecasts for your restaurant. Access is limited, and we do not share your sales data with third parties. If you ever want your data to be removed, you can let us know and we will delete it.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q11.question': 'What locations do you support?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q11.answer': 'We support restaurants worldwide. Weather information is updated automatically from accurate global coverage and combined with your sales history to produce your forecast. Pricing is in euros, but we are happy to work with restaurants in any country.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q12.question': 'Does the dashboard include drinks?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q12.answer': 'Currently, the dashboard focuses on food items. We are working on adding drink forecasting capabilities and expect to launch this feature in early 2026.', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q13.question': 'What\'s coming next?', // TODO: Translate
    'faq.q13.answer': 'We are developing drink forecasting and category-level predictions, planned for launch in early 2026. Early users will be the first to get access to these new features.', // TODO: Translate
